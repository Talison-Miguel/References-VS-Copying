    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = {...person}
    console.log('copy spred', cap, person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
